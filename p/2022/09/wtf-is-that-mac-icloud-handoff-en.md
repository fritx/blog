I seldom use iPad myself, so when I face it I got totally shocked 😱

Imagine this:

> You're browsing some 🔞 secrets in your Mac

> and one of your family members just happens to use your iPad (with the same AppleID)

> iPad is gonna show an access to that page 😲, without any permission

> even if you're using Chrome! not only for Safari

so Apple never cares about privacy and security (for this scenario)?

so What the F**k is that!

### Concerns about Privacy and Security

We all know that Apple's iCloud syncing can be insecure (like the "Photo Syncing")

so I've been always keeping the risk under control

for example, I have "Photo Syncing" off in Apple devices, and use Android phones

Everything was going well, until this * refreshed my view!

### How to solve it?

I tried turning off "Safari Syncing" in iCloud, but it didn't work

When I searched for the keywords "ipad safari can view mac", I found:

> **See the webpages open on your other devices in Safari on Mac -- _Safari User Guide_**<br>
> https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/see-the-webpages-open-on-your-other-devices-sfri40726/mac

> **Pick up where you left off with Handoff on Mac -- _macOS User Guide_**<br>
> https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/hand-off-tasks-between-devices-mchl732d3c0a/mac

and what exactly "Handoff" [is](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209455):

> **Use Handoff to continue tasks on your other devices**<br>
> With Handoff, you can start work on one device,<br>
> then switch to another nearby device and pick up where you left off.

I finally figured out what the hell 👻 was that, and how to solve it

### Turn "Handoff" on or off

> - On your Mac: Choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click General , then select “Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices” (at the bottom of the pane). To turn it off, deselect the option.
> - On iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch: Go to Settings > General > AirPlay & Handoff, then turn Handoff on or off.
> - On Apple Watch: Open the Apple Watch app on iPhone, go to My Watch > General, then turn Enable Handoff on or off.

So in your Mac, click on the top left corner

choose "System Preferences" > "General", and turn off this "Handoff" shit 💩
